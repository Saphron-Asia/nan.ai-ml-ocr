# Nan.ai Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Nan.ai  is an open source machine learning service that extracts data from form images with handwritten inputs. This ML service is created to support Nan.ai, a grassroots agent platform for microinsurance. Nan.ai OCR ML service can be used for other use cases such as (insert examples here) and trained using the nan.ai OCR Open Data. This ML service is tailor fit for optimizing the workflow for Saphron.asia, however, as a public good it can be reused for other  scenarios in need of OCR service.

nan.ai OCR ML service has three components:

1. Validation - pre-processing component that adjusts image quality and identification of regions of interest
2. Extraction - data extraction workflow that segregates region of interest into input fields then recognizing and recording form inputs from handwriting
3. Encoding - annotation workflow that aids labelling datasets to improve the OCR model. Encoding inputs are used to improve autocorrect suggestions.

You can participate by (1) reporting bugs or (2) suggesting improvements on implementation. To explore our ML service, you can use the existing notebooks available here or export model by ``(insert instructions here)``.

Alongside our open source initiative, we are also open sourcing related datasets, nan.ai OCR Open [`Data`](https://github.com/Saphron-Asia/nan.ai-opendata-ocr), to help you explore and train this model.
